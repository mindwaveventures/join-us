## Introductions

I like updating my code by each project on in the same project. My main motive is to contribute in some high level products, so that I can proudly says "Ye mene banaya hai😁".

- Well somewhere in my heart I want to create mobile application too. So I messed around with both React Native and Flutter. Somehow I created some demo apps in React Native🤭.
- Node Js, VS Code, SSH is the most tools I use day to day life. Mostly I work with MacOS and Ubuntu. VS Code is my lover and Sublime is my EX😂.
- I am more into Backend but I also love frontend. I can't choose between both of them so I want both of them🫣.
- Obviously, I would love to learn something out of my domain. That would be a like dessert for me after filling my stomach full with indian food☺️.
- Currently I focusing on DSA and Test Cases😵.
