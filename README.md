# Note :

Hello recruiter,

I have provided all the answers as requested. The only issue I faced was that the code indentation is not visible after saving the file or committing the changes. However, it's properly visible when we click on edit. I wanted to bring this to your attention. Additionally, I really appreciate this method of assessment using Git.

Thank you for this wonderful opportunity.
